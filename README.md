# Focus Timer - Multi-Timer PWA

A professional-grade timer application built with vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating state management, data persistence, and dynamic UI rendering.

## Features
- ✅ Multiple independent timers
- ✅ Progress visualization
- ✅ Data persistence (localStorage)
- ✅ Professional validation
- ✅ Alarm system with visual/vibration feedback

## Technical Highlights
- State-driven UI (DOM as function of data)
- Event delegation for dynamic elements
- CRUD operations on timer objects
- LocalStorage serialization/deserialization
- CSS animations and transitions

## Platform Limitations
This PWA works perfectly in desktop browsers. On iOS Safari, JavaScript suspension when screen locks and autoplay restrictions limit alarm functionality. A native iOS version is in development to provide full background execution and reliable audio alerts.

## Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- LocalStorage API
- Web Audio API
- Vibration API
